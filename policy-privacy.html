                          Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                          commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                          to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                          stored on your device's internal memory.
                        </p> <p>
                          This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                          the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
                          “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

                          I want to inform users of this Service

                          Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                          them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                          disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                          acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                          of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
